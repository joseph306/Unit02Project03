                    <h1>An Incredible Game</h1>
                    <p>------------------</p>
                    <p>the artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
                    and one of the best around. As 
                    for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
                    are tough decisions to make every 
                    turn. It's not only important to select the character 
                    that increases your chances for scoring, 
                    but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
                    are likely to select, and then hedge against 
                    their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
                    and deep strategic thinking. However, 
                    it can still be played at a more basic level for 
                    younger users.</p>
                    
                    <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
                    Best in its Class. Highly recommended.</p>
