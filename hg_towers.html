                    <p><h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2></p>
                    <p>--------------------</p>
                    <p>Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
                    Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
                    Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
                    Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
                    the administration of a city. Each role provides 
                    a different ability and strategy. However, 
                    one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
                    must be constantly aware of betrayal 
                    and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
                    of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
                    and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
                    carefully choose his or her roles and 
                    the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
                    of a card. However the level of randomness is 
                    just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
                    overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
                    recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
                    players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
                    and some of the game appeal.</p>
